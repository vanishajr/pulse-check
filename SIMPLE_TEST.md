# PR Monitoring System Test

This file is used to test the automated PR performance monitoring and observability analysis system.

## Test Purpose

When a PR is created or updated with changes to this file, it will trigger:

1. **Basic Workflow** (`pr-monitor.yml`) - Provides observability analysis and recommendations
2. **Comprehensive Workflow** (`complete-pr-analysis.yml`) - Full performance testing with Grafana dashboards

## What to Expect

### PR Comments
You should receive automated comments containing:
- ✅ **Observability analysis** with OpenTelemetry recommendations
- 📊 **Grafana dashboard configurations** for monitoring
- 🔧 **Code suggestions** for implementing tracing and metrics
- 📈 **Performance metrics** and grading (from comprehensive workflow)

### Dashboard Access
The comprehensive workflow provides:
- 🎯 **Live Grafana Dashboard** - http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- 📊 **Prometheus Metrics** - http://localhost:9090
- 📋 **Application Logs** - http://localhost:3100
- 🔍 **Trace Analysis** - http://localhost:3200

## Testing Instructions

1. **Create a test change** - Modify this file or add content
2. **Commit and push** to a new branch
3. **Open a Pull Request** 
4. **Watch GitHub Actions** run the monitoring workflows
5. **Check PR comments** for automated analysis
6. **Access dashboards** (if running comprehensive workflow)

## Current Test Status

**Last Updated:** 2024-12-19
**Test Counter:** 2  
**Test Type:** Observability Analysis Trigger
**Expected Workflows:** Both basic and comprehensive monitoring

### Sample Code for Testing OpenTelemetry Integration

```python
# Example: Adding OpenTelemetry to a Flask app
from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor

app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)

@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("hello_endpoint"):
        return {"message": "Hello from monitored endpoint!"}
```

### Expected Monitoring Metrics

- **Request Rate:** `sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))`
- **P95 Latency:** `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`
- **Error Rate:** `rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])`
