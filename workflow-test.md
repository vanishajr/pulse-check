# GitHub Actions Workflow Test

This file is created to trigger the PR monitoring workflows for testing purposes.

## Test Objectives
- Verify GitHub Actions workflows execute properly on PR creation
- Test the monitoring stack deployment (Docker, Grafana, Prometheus)
- Validate performance metrics collection and dashboard functionality
- Check automated PR analysis and reporting features

## What Gets Tested
1. **Docker Environment Setup**
   - Application deployment
   - Grafana dashboard provisioning
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Service health checks

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Load generation and metrics collection
   - Response time analysis
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Resource utilization tracking

3. **Reporting & Visualization**
   - Grafana dashboard accessibility
   - Performance report generation
   - PR comment automation
   - Snapshot creation

## Expected Workflow Execution
- `pr-monitor.yml`: Basic monitoring with 5-minute dashboard viewing window
- `complete-pr-analysis.yml`: Comprehensive analysis with detailed reporting

## Verification Steps
After PR creation, check:
- [ ] GitHub Actions tab shows running workflows
- [ ] Docker services start successfully
- [ ] Grafana becomes accessible at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Prometheus collects metrics at http://localhost:9090
- [ ] Application responds at http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Performance reports are posted to PR
- [ ] Environment cleanup completes successfully
