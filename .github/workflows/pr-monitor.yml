### 📊 **Dashboard Access** (Available for ~5 minutes during workflow)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
  - Navigate to "PR Performance Overview" dashboard
  - Check "Latency & Error Analysis" for detailed metrics
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
  - View raw metrics and targets status
- **Application**: http://localhost:8000
  - Health: http://localhost:8000/health
  - Hello: http://localhost:8000/hello

### 📈 **Generated Test Data**
- ~150 HTTP requests across multiple endpoints
- Variable response times for latency analysis
- Branch-specific metrics labeled with: \`${context.payload.pull_request.head.ref}\`

### 🔍 **What to Look For**
- Request rate graphs showing activity spikes
- P95 latency measurements
- HTTP status code distribution
- Application logs with branch information

### ⏰ **Timing**
- Dashboard viewing window: **5 minutes** during workflow execution
- Look for the "Dashboard viewing pause" step in the workflow logs
- Data persists until Docker cleanup at workflow end
